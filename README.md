This is a personal research and experiment, not meant for publishing and production usage.
The goals of this the experiment are:

- test how difficult would it be to write set of components with LitElement
- identify which parts of code could be re-used by LitElement and Polymer 3
- investigate the possible styling and theming approaches for LitElement
